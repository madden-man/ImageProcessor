# README

This is a project created for the sake of understanding
Programming Languages and related concepts/topics better.
We have created a Ruby on Rails server for the sake of
developing an algorithm to better find the z-depth of
pixels in an image. Currently it is still in development.

ruby 2.3.1p112 (2016-04-26) [x86_64-linux-gnu]

TO DEPLOY:

1. Make sure you have Ruby running on your computer, with Rails configured.
2. Clone this repository
3. Run command "rails server"
4. Navigate to "http://localhost:3000" and find our project (undeveloped for the most part!)
